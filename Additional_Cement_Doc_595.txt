Blended Hydraulic Cements1
This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation C595/C595M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.A superscript epsilon ( ´) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the Department of Defense.
1. Scope*
1.1 This speciﬁcation pertains to blended hydraulic cements
for both general and special applications, using slag or pozzo-lan, or both, with portland cement or portland cement clinker orslag with lime.
NOTE 1—This speciﬁcation prescribes ingredients and proportions,
with some performance requirements whereas Performance Speciﬁcation
C1157 is a hydraulic cement speciﬁcation in which performance criteria
alone govern the products and their acceptance.
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated ineach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, eachsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combiningvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformancewith the standard. Values in SI units [or inch-pound units] shallbe obtained by measurement in SI units [or inch-pound units]or by appropriate conversion, using the Rules for Conversionand Rounding given in
IEEE/ASTM SI 10 , of measurements
made in other units [or SI units]. Values are stated in only SIunits when inch-pound units are not used in practice.
1.3 The text of this standard refers to notes and footnotes
which provide explanatory material. These notes and footnotes(excluding those in tables and ﬁgures) are not requirements ofthe standard.

System of Units (SI): the Modern Metric System
3. Terminology
3.1 Deﬁnitions —The terms used in this speciﬁcation are
deﬁned in Terminology C219 , except for the following terms:
3.1.1 binary blended cement ,n—a blended hydraulic ce-
ment consisting of portland cement with either a slag cement ora pozzolan.
3.1.2 ternary blended cement ,n—a blended hydraulic ce-
ment consisting of portland cement with either a combinationof two different pozzolans, or slag cement and a pozzolan.
4. Classiﬁcation
4.1 This speciﬁcation applies to the following types of
blended cement that generally are intended for use as indicated.
4.1.1 Blended hydraulic cements for general concrete con-
struction.
4.1.1.1 Type IS —Portland blast-furnace slag cement.
4.1.1.2 Type IP —Portland-pozzolan cement.
4.1.1.3 Type IT —Ternary blended cement.
4.2 Reporting :
4.2.1 The naming practice for blended cements shall be
made by adding the suffix (X) to the type designation under
4.1.1 , where (X) equals the targeted percentage of slag or
pozzolan in the product expressed as a whole number by massof the ﬁnal blended product, within the allowable variation asstated in
14.3.
4.2.2 The naming practice for ternary blended cements shall
be made by adding the suffixes (AX) and (BY) to the Type ITdesignation under
4.1.1 , where:
A is either “S” for slag cement, or “P” for pozzolan,
whichever is present in larger amount by mass, and
X is the targeted percentage by mass of constituent A, andB is either “S” for slag cement, or “P” for pozzolan, andY is the targeted percentage by mass of constituent B.
Both X and Y values are expressed as a whole number by
mass of the ﬁnal blended product, within the allowablevariation as stated in
14.3. If X and Y are the same, list the
pozzolan content ﬁrst.
NOTE 2—Examples of the naming practice per 4.2.1 and4.3are shown
below (all percentages by mass):
Binary blended cement with 80 % portland cement and 20 % slag
cement = Type IS(20).
Binary blended cement with 85 % portland cement and 15 % pozzolan
= Type IP(15).
Ternary blended cement with 70 % portland cement, 20 % slag cementand 10 % pozzolan = Type IT(S20)(P10).
Ternary blended cement with 65 % portland cement, 25 % of one
pozzolan and 10 % of another pozzolan = Type IT(P25)(P10).
Ternary blended cement with 60 % portland cement and 20 % of
slag cement and 20 % pozzolan = Type IT(P20)(S20).
4.2.3 A simpliﬁed naming practice is used in this standard
for practicality and clarity when referring to speciﬁc require-ments for binary and ternary blended cements that are appli-cable to a range of products or in ternary blended cementswhen requirements are applicable to only one constituentwithin a speciﬁc range (%). (See
Note 3 )
NOTE 3—Examples of the simpliﬁed naming practices per 4.2.3 are
shown below:
1) An example when requirements are applicable to a range of products
can be found in Table 1 , where the maximum SO3content of 3 % applies
to: binary blended cements with slag cement contents <70 %, indicated asIS(<70); ternary blended cements with a pozzolan content less than theslag cement content and the slag cement content is less than 70 %,indicated as IT(P<S<70).
2) An example when requirements are applicable to only one constitu-
ent within a speciﬁc range (%) of that constituent can be found in
8.2,
where testing is required only when the slag cement content is <25 %.Because the requirement is based on the slag cement content only with norelation to the pozzolan content, a simpliﬁed naming practice is employedand the range of ternary blended cements are indicated as Type IT(S<25).
4.3 Special Properties :
4.3.1 Air-entraining cement, when desired by the purchaser,
shall be speciﬁed by adding the suffix (A) to any of the abovetypes. The air-entraining option is speciﬁed in combinationwith any of the other special properties where required.
NOTE 4—A given mass of blended cement has a larger absolute volume
than the same mass of portland cement. This should be taken intoconsideration in purchasing cements and in proportioning concrete mix-tures.
4.3.2 Moderate sulfate resistance or moderate heat of hy-
dration, or both, when desired by the purchaser, shall bespeciﬁed by adding the suffix (MS) or (MH), respectively, tothe type designation under
4.1.1 .
4.3.3 High sulfate resistance, when desired by the pur-
chaser, shall be speciﬁed by adding the suffix (HS) to the typedesignation under
4.1.1 .
NOTE 5—Special characteristics attributable to slag or pozzolan will
vary based on quantities contained within the blended cements.
NOTE 6—There are cases where performance of a cement is improved
with SO3in excess of the Table 1 limits in this speciﬁcation. Test Method
C563 is one of several methods a manufacturer can use to evaluate the
effect of sulfate content on cement characteristics. Whenever SO3content
of a cement exceeds Table 1 limits, Test Method C1038 results provide

A1. ACTIVITY INDEX WITH PORTLAND CEMENT
A1.1 Specimen Preparation
A1.1.1 Mold, cure, and test the specimens from a control
mix and from a test mix in accordance with Test Method
C109/C109M . The portland cement used in the control mix
shall meet the requirements of Speciﬁcation C150 , and shall be
the type, and if available, the brand of cement to be used in thework. Make three-cube batches as follows: (For 6- or 9-cubebatches, double or triple, respectively, the amounts of dryingredients.)
A1.1.1.1 Control Mix :
250 g of portland cement687.5 g of graded Ottawa sandX mL of water required for ﬂow of 100 to 115
A1.1.1.2 Pozzolan Test Mix :
162.5 g of portland cementg of pozzolan:87.5 3sp gr of the sample/sp gr of the portland cement

75 g of portland cementg of slag:175 3sp gr of the slag/sp gr of the portland cement
687.5 g of graded Ottawa sandZ mL of water required for ﬂow of 100 to 115
A1.2 Storage of Specimens
A1.2.1 After molding, place the specimens and molds (on
the base plates) in the moist room or closet at 23.0 62.0 °C
[73.5 63.5 °F] for 20 to 24 h. While in the moist room or
closet, protect the surface from dripping water. Remove themolds from the moist room or closet and remove the cubesfrom the molds. Place the cubes in close-ﬁtting metal or glasscontainers (
Note A1.1 ), seal the containers airtight, and store at
38.0 62.0 °C [100.0 63.5 °F] for 27 days. Allow the
specimens to cool to 23.0 62.0 °C [73.5 63.5 °F] before
testing.
NOTE A1.1—Use any metal container having a capacity of three cubes
if it can be sealed airtight by soldering. Containers of light-tinned sheetmetal with inside dimensions of 52 by 52 by 160 mm [2 by 2 by 6.25 in.]
have been found to be satisfactory. Wide-mouth Mason jars of 1-Lcapacity have been found to be satisfactory, provided care is taken toprevent breakage.
(Warning —Fresh hydraulic cementitious mixtures are caustic and may
cause chemical burns to skin and tissue upon prolonged exposure.)

A1.3 Compressive Strength Test
A1.3.1 Determine the compressive strength of the three
specimens of the control mix and of the test mix at an age of28 days in accordance with Test Method
C109/C109M .
A1.4 Calculation
A1.4.1 Calculate the activity index with portland cement as
follows:
Activity index with portland cement 5 ~A/B!3100 (A1.1)
where:
A= average compressive strength of test mix cubes, MPa,
and
B= average compressive strength of control mix cubes,
MPa.
A1.5 Precision and Bias
A1.5.1 Precision —Single operator precision, on blended
cements using ﬂy ash is essentially the same as on ﬂyash/cement blends in Research Report C09-1001
5and it was
found to have 3.8 % coefficient of variation (1s %). Thisindicates that results of two properly conducted tests by thesame operator are not expected to differ by more than 10.7 %(d2s) of the average of two results. Since the test is performedsolely for the purpose of manufacturer certiﬁcation of rawmaterial quality, no multilaboratory precision is applicable.
A1.5.2 Bias—Since there are no standard reference materi-
als, bias cannot be determined.
