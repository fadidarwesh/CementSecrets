14. Preparation of Mortar
14.1 Proportions for Mortar —Mortar for air entrainment,
compressive strength, and water retention tests shall be pro-portioned to contain 1620 g of sand and a mass of cement, ingrams, in accordance with
Table 2 . The sand shall consist of
810 g of graded standard sand and 810 g of 20–30 standardsand (
Note 1 ). The quantity of water, measured in millilitres

NOTE 1—Historically, ﬁeld-mixed mortar has been proportioned by
volume measured in increments or fractions of ft3. The comparable whole
SI-unit volume to 1 ft3is 28 L. The speciﬁed mortar proportions
approximate the 1:3 nominal proportions by volume, commonly speciﬁedfor construction, on the basis of the following assumed mass and volumerelationships:
The mass of dry sand in 28 L of loose damp sand is 36 kg.28 L Type N masonry cement has a mass of 32 kg.28 L Type S masonry cement has a mass of 34 kg.28 L Type M masonry cement has a mass of 36 kg.
For example, the amount of cement needed to provide a 1:3
volume proportion of cement to sand using a Type N masonrycement is as follows:
A51620 3~C/B!51620 3~32/108 !5480 (1)

determining ﬂow, determining air entrainment, and starting themolding of cubes shall be within 8 min.
16.1.2 Storage —Immediately after molding, store all test
specimens in the molds on plane plates in a moist cabinet ormoist room for 48 to 52 h in such a manner that the uppersurfaces shall be exposed to the moist air. Then remove thecubes from the molds, and place them in the moist cabinet ormoist room for 5 days in such a manner as to allow freecirculation of air around at least ﬁve faces of the specimens. Atthe age of 7 days, immerse the cubes for the 28-day tests insaturated lime water in storage tanks of noncorrodible materi-als.

removal from the moist cabinet or moist room for 7-dayspecimens, and immediately after their removal from storagewater for all other specimens. If more than one specimen at a
time is removed from the moist cabinet or moist room for7-day tests, cover these cubes with a damp cloth until the timeof testing.

20.3 At the option of the purchaser, cement remaining in
storage prior to shipment for a period greater than six monthsafter testing shall be retested and, at the option of the purchasershall be rejected if it fails to meet any of the requirements ofthis speciﬁcation.

NOTE 2—To facilitate the change to SI units, a standard SI package size
of 32 kg for Type N, 34 kg for Type S, and 36 kg for Type M will provideconvenient mass increments reasonably similar to the traditional 70-, 75-,and 80-lb packages.TABLE 2 Cement in Laboratory Batch of Mortar
