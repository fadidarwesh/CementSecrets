Introduction
It is necessary that users of th is specification be aware that further or differing requirements can be required for
individual applications. This s pecification is not intended to inhibit a vendor from offering, or the purchaser from
accepting, alternative equipment  or engineering solutions for t he individual application. T his can be particularly
applicable where there is innov ative or developing technology. Where an alternative is offered, it is the responsibility
of the vendor to identif y any variations fro m this specificatio n and provide details.
In this specification, where prac tical, US Customary (USC) unit s are included in brackets for information. The units do
not necessarily represent a direc t conversion of SI to USC unit s, or USC to SI units. Cons ideration has been given to
the precision of the instrument m aking the measurement. For exa mple, thermometers are typically marked in 1°
increments, thus temperature  values have been rounded to the ne arest degree.
In this specification, calibra ting an instrument refers to assu ring the accuracy of the measurement. Accuracy is the
degree of conformity of a measurement of a quantity to its actu al or true value. Accuracy is related to precision, or
reproducibility, of a measurement. Precision is the degree to w hich further measurements or calculations will show
the same or similar results. Precision is characterized in term s of the standard deviation of the measurement. The
results of calculations or a measurement can be accurate, but n ot precise, precise but not a ccurate, neither or both. A
result is valid i f it is both accu rate and precise.

Cements and Materials for Well Cementing 
1 Scope 
1.1 General 
This document specifies requirements and gives recommendations for six classes of well cements, and two 
classes of composite well cements including their chemical and physical requirements, and procedures for 
physical testing.  
This specification is  applicable to well ce ment classes A, B, C , and D, which are the products obtained by grinding 
Portland cement clinker and, if needed, calcium sulfate (CaSO 4) as an interground additive. Processing additives 
can be used in the manufacture of cement of these classes. Suit able set-modifying agents can be interground or 
blended during the manufacture of Class D cement. Annex B descr ibes composite well cement classes K and L, 
which are the products obtained by intergrinding Portland cemen t clinker and one or more forms of CaSO 4 with 
composite constituents, or by subsequent blending of separately  produced Portland cement with separately 
processed composite constituent s. Composite constituents are al so specified in Annex B. 
This specification is also applicable to well cement classes G and H, which are the products obtained by grinding 
clinker with no additives other than one or more forms of CaSO 4, water, or chemical additives as required for 
chromium (VI) reduction. 
1.2 Application of the API Monogram 
When product is manufactured at a facility licensed by API and is intended to be supplied bearing the 
API Monogram, the requirements of Annex A shall apply. 
1.3 Use of Metric SI and US Customary Units 
This document contains metric SI and US customary oilfield unit s. For the purposes of this document, the 
conversion between the systems is not exact and has been intent ionally rounded to allow for ease of use in 
calibration and measurement.

 Curing 
 Curing Periods 
The curing period is the time elapsed from subjecting the speci mens to the specified temperature in the curing 
vessel (or initiating the temper ature/pressure schedule given i n Table 7) to testing the specimen for strength. The 
strength of the specimen shall be tested at the appropriate tim e, shown in Table 8. 
For specimens cured at atmospheric pressure (Class A, B, C, G, and H cements), the curing period starts when 
specimens are initially placed in the curing bath preheated to the test temperature. The te st temperature shall be 
maintained at ±2 °C (±3 °F). 
For specimens cured at above atmospheric pressure (Class D ceme nt), the curing period starts with the initial 
application of pressure and temperature. 
 Specimen Cooling 
Specimens cured at 60 °C (140 °F) and below shall be removed fr om the curing bath 45 min ±5 min before the 
time at which they will be test ed. Specimens shall be removed f rom their molds and cooled by being placed in a 
water cooling bath maintained at  27 °C ±3 °C (80 °F ±5 °F) for 40 min ±5 min. Do not leave the specimen out of 
water for more than 5 min to avoid dehydration.  
For Class D specimens cured at temperatures equal to or greater  than 77 °C (170 °F) under pressure, maintain 
the maximum scheduled temperatur e and pressure given in Table 8  until 105 min ±5 min pri or to the time at which 
the specimens will be tested; at that point, discontinue heatin g. During the next 60 min ±5 min, decrease the 
temperature to 77 °C (170 °F) or less, without a reduction in t he pressure other than that caused by the reduction 
in temperature. At 45 min ±5 min p rior to the time at which the  specimens will be tested, release the remaining

pressure and remove the specimens from the molds. Cool the spec imens by transferring them to a water cooling 
bath maintained at 27 °C ±3 °C ( 80 °F ±5 °F) for 40 min ±5 min.  Do not leave specimens out of water for more 
than 5 min to avoid dehydration.  
 Specimen Acceptance 
Cube-test specimens that are damaged shall be discarded prior t o testing. If fewer than two test specimens are 
left for determining the compressive st rength at any given peri od, a retest shall be made. 
9.3 Test Procedure  
In order to condu ct the compressive str ength test, the followin g procedure shall be followed. 
a) Remove specimens from the water bath or the cooling bath tha t has been maintained at 27 °C ±3 °C 
(80 °F ±5 °F); wipe each specimen  to remove any loose material from the faces that will be in contact with the 
bearing blocks of the  testing machine. 
b) The dimensions of the cube height shall be measured to ±1.6 mm (50-mm mold) or to ±1/16 in. (2-in. mold) for 
calculation of the cr oss-sectional area.  
c) If the cube height is less than 47.5 mm (cube prepared using  a 50-mm mold) or less than 1.9 in. (cube 
prepared using a 2-in. mold), t he cube should be discarded. 
d) Place the specimen in the test ing machine centered below the  upper bearing block.  
1) The load will be applied to the specimen faces that were in contact with the plane (vertical) surfaces of 
the mold (not in contact with t he base or the co ver plates). 
2) Prior to the testing of each cube, ascertain that the spheri cally seated block is free to tilt.  
3) Use no cushioning or bedding materials. 
e) Apply the load to the cube-specimen. The rate of loading sha ll be 18 kN/min ±2 kN/min (4000 lbf/min ±400 
lbf/min) for specimens that were cured for 8 hours at 38 °C (10 0 °F). For all other specimens cured at any 
other temperature, time, or pressure, the rate of loading shall  be 72 kN/min ±7 kN/min (16,000 lbf/min ±1600 
lbf/min). 
Caution—Employ appropriate safety and handling procedures in te sting the specimen. 
f) Calculate the compressive strength expressed in megapascals (pounds force per square inch) as the force 
required to break the sample divided by the smallest calculated  cross-sectional area in contact with the load-
bearing plates of the load frame. 
9.4 Compressive Strength Acceptance Criteria 
The compressive strength of all acceptance-test specimens made from the same sample and tested at the same 
period shall be recorded and averaged to the nearest 0.1 MPa (1 0 lbf/in.²). At least two- thirds of the original 
individual specimens and the average of all the specimens teste d shall meet or exceed the minimum compressive 
strength given in Table 8. A retest shall be made if fewer than  two strength values are left for determining the 
compressive strength at any given period.

10.2 Calibration 
 General 
Measurement of the thickening-ti me of a cement slurry requires calibration and maintena nce of operating systems 
of the pressurized consistometer, including consistency measure ment, temperature-measuring systems, 
temperature controllers, motor speeds, timers, and gauges, as w ell as the slurry container assembly for wear. All 
apparatuses are calibrated according to Annex C.

32  API  SPECIFICATION 10A 
 Consistency 
Consistency of cement slurry is expressed in Bearden units of c onsistency, Bc. This value shall be determined by 
a torque measurement device (see Figure 14 for a typical potent iometer mechanism) and voltage measurement 
circuit that has been calibr ated according to Annex C. 
The calibration method as specified in Annex C shall be used, a s well as procedures in the potentiometer 
manufacturer’s instructions manual. A weight-loaded device (see  Figure C.2 for a typical potentiometer calibrating 
device) is used to produce a series of torque equivalent values  for consistency for calibration. Dedicated 
potentiometer calibration weights are used to apply torque to t he potentiometer spring, using the radius of the 
potentiometer frame as a lever arm. As dedicated calibration we ights are added, the spring is deflected and 
resulting DC voltage and/or Bc increases.

 Temperature-measuring System 
The temperature-measuring system shall be accurate to ±1 °C (±2 °F); see Annex C. Calibration procedure details 
as given in Annex D are commonly used.  
 Motor Speed 
The motor shall meet the requi rements given in Annex C. 
 Timers 
Timers shall be accurate to within ±5 seconds per hour. If not within required accuracy, the units shall be adjusted 
or replaced. 
 Pressure-measuring System 
Calibration shall be conducted against a dead -weight tester or master gauge; see Annex C.  
 Slurry Container Assembly  
A caliper accurate to 0.1 mm (0.005 in.) at minimum is required  to verify pressurized consistometer key 
dimensions (dimensions tagged as “INSP” shown in Figures 10 thr ough 13) for wear of slurry container assembly 
parts; see Annex C.  
10.3 Procedure 
 Operating Instructions 
Detailed operating instructions developed by the operator or fu rnished by the equipment manufacturer are 
applicable for this method and shall be followed, provided they  conform to the specifications contained in this 
specification. Grease may be pl aced only on the threaded surfac es of the slurry container. 
 Assembling and Filling the Slurry Container 
Inspect and assemble the slurry cup, prepare the slurry accordi ng to Section 7, and fill the slurry container by the 
following steps: 
1) Ensure the cup and threads are clean. 
2) Inspect the diaphragm and r eplace it if it is damaged. 
3) Assemble the paddle shaft assembly and diaphragm with diaphr agm support ring and backup plate, and 
secure them in the cup sleeve with the flange ring (the paddle and inside of the cup sleeve should not be 
greased, as some greases have been found to affect thickening-t ime results). Ensure the tapered side of the 
diaphragm support ring is agains t the diaphragm for the best se al. 
4) Assemble the base and center plug (pivot bearing) and make s ure the paddle turns freely. 
5) Remove the base and pivot beari ng. Grease the threads of the  cup on the base end to ease removal 
following the test. Gre ase the threads of t he center plug to ea se removal. 
6) With the base end of the slu rry container up, prepare the sl urry according to Section 7 and fill to the top (or 
leaving two to three threads showing); 
7) Strike the cup and remove any  air that rises to the top of t he slurry.

8) Install the base until slurry  is extruded through the center  hole. 
9) Install the center plug (pivot  bearing) into the container a nd tighten it until both the plug and base are tight in 
the container. 
10) Rinse all cement from the outer surfaces and dry them. 
11) Recheck the paddle to ens ure it turns smoothly. 
 Initiation of Test 
 Place the filled slu rry container on the drive table in the pr essure vessel, start r otation of the slurry 
container, and secure the potentio meter mechanism or other suit able device for measurin g consistency so as to 
engage the paddle shaft drive bar . Begin filling the vessel wit h oil. The paddle shaft s hould not be rotating. 
NOTE Some consistometers fill w ith oil faster than others. Begi n filling those that fill quickly after the head assembly has 
been secured in the pressure vessel.  
 Secure the head assembly in t he pressure vesse l and insert the  thermocouple through its fitting, and 
partially engage the threads. Afte r the pressure vessel is comp letely filled with oil, ti ghten the threads of the 
thermocouple. 
 Begin the thickening-time test b y applying the initial pressur e and starting the temperature ramp. No 
more than 5 min should have elapsed after cessation of mixing o f the slurry as specified in 7.2.5 and the 
beginning of the test.  
 Temperature and Pressure Control 
During the test period, increase the temperature and pressure o f the cement slurry in the slurry container in 
accordance with the appropriate specification schedule given in  Tables 9, 10, and 11. During the ramp of schedules 
4, 5, and 6, the temperature and pressure shall be maintained w ithin ±3 °C (±5 °F) and ±2 MPa (±300 lbf/in.²lbf/in.²) of 
their targets, respectively, v ersus the appropriate elapsed tim e. Within 10 min after the end of the ramp, the 
temperature and pressure shall be within ±1 °C (±2 °F) and ±0.7 MPa ( ±100 lbf/in.²lbf/in.²), respectively, of the 
specified values. Determine the temperature of the cement slurr y for specification testing by the use of a 
temperature-measuring device l ocated in the center of the sampl e container. 
The tip of the thermocouple shall be vertically positioned with in the paddle shaft in the slurry cup in such a way 
that it is between 45 mm (1.77 in.) and 89 mm (3.5 in.) above t he inside of the base of the sample container. As 
there are many models of consist ometers having different dimens ions, care shall be taken to ensure that the 
thermocouple used is compatible w ith the consistometer and that  the position of the tip of the thermocouple is in 
the correct location specified above.

Annex A 
(informative) 
API Monogram Program  
Use of the API Monogram by Licensees 
A.1 Scope  
The API Monogram® is a registered certification ma rk owned by the American Petro leum Institute (API) and 
authorized for licensing by the API Board of Directors. Through  the API Monogram Program, API licenses product 
manufacturers to apply the API Monogram to new products which c omply with product specifications and have 
been manufactured under a qualit y management system that meets the requirements of API Spec Q1. API 
maintains a complete, searchable list of all Monogram licensees  on the API Composite List website 
(http://compositelist.api.org ).  
The application of the API Monogram and license number on produ cts constitutes a representation and warranty 
by the licensee to API and to purchasers of the products that, as of the date indicated, the products were 
manufactured under a quality management system conforming to th e requirements of API Spec Q1 and that the 
product conforms in every deta il with the applicable standard(s ) or product specification(s). API Monogram 
Program licenses are issued only after on-site audits have veri fied that an organization has implemented and 
continually maintained a quality management system that meets t he requirements of API Spec Q1 and that the 
resulting products satisfy the requirements of the applicable A PI product specification(s) and/or standard(s). 
Although any manufacturer may claim that its products meet API product requirements without monogramming 
them, only manufacturers with a license from API can apply the API Monogram to their products. 
Together with the requirements of the API Monogram license agre ement, this annex establishes the requirements 
for those organizations who wish to voluntarily obtain an API l icense to provide API monogrammed products that

A.7 Manufacturing Capability  
The API Monogram Program is designed to identify facilities tha t have demonstrated the ability to manufacture 
equipment that conforms to API specifications and/or standards.  API may refuse initial licensing or suspend 
current licensing based on a facility’s level of manufacturing capability. If API determines that additional review is 
warranted, API may perform additional audits (at the organizati on’s expense) of any primary subcontractors to 
ensure their compliance with applicable specifications. 
Facilities with capabilities that  are limited to the processes or activities defined below do not meet the 
manufacturing capability requirements to produce new products, and therefore, shall not be licensed or be the 
basis for licensing under the API Monogram Program: 
— Capabilities that are limited to performing final inspection and testing of the product, except for testing     
agencies as Specified in API S pec 14A and/or API Spec 6AV 
— Buying, selling and/or distributing finished products and mat erials;

Composite Well Cements 
B.1 General 
Composite well cements consist of Portland cement and additiona l constituent(s) such as s ilica, fly ash ( coal ash), 
expanded shale, clay, or any other  natural, processed, or manma de materials that are either blended or 
interground. Such composite well cements have been manufactured  by cement manufacturers and others, and 
have a long and successful history of use for cementing oil and  gas wells. Such composite well cements are 
appropriate for cementing oil or gas wells when used by themsel ves or when blended with other materials to 
enhance their properties to meet the well conditions, and all a ppropriate design and regulatory requirements for 
mixing, placement, and pe rformance in the well. 
This annex defines specifications for certain composite well ce ments that are manufactured by facilities having a 
fully implemented, recognized quality management system in plac e, but does not precl ude the use of other 
composite well cements as described above for use in wells when  such composite well cements meet the 
requirements of the well. 
The physical and chemical specifications for composite well cem ents described in this annex may also be used 
for reference testing of field blended composite well cements b efore tailoring them to the specific well cement 
conditions. 
B.2 Specification, Chemical, and Physical Requirements 
 Classes and Grades 
B.2.1.1 General 
Composite well cements according to this annex shall be specifi ed using Classes K and L. Class K is available in 
different grades : ordinary (O), m oderate sulfate-resistant (MSR ), and high sulfate-resistant (HSR). 
Composite well cement by this annex shall be manufactured at fa cilities having a fully i mplemented, recognized 
quality management system in place  such as, but not limited to,  API Specification Q1. 
Composite well cement is obtaine d by intergrinding Portland cem ent clinker and one or more forms of CaSO 4 with 
composite constituents as specified in B.2.2, or by subsequent blending of separately produced Portland cement 
with separately processed compos ite constituents as specified i n B.2.2. 
Composite well cement that has been manufactured and supplied i n accordance with this annex may be mixed 
and placed in the field using water ratios or additives at the user’s discretion. It is not  intended that manufacturing 
compliance with this part of API Specificati on 10A be based on such field conditions. 
Processing additives, set modify ing agents, or chemical additiv es to reduce chromium (VI ) are permitted, provided 
that such additives do not prev ent the composite well cement fr om performing its intended functions. 
B.2.1.2 Class K 
Class K composite well cement is obtained by intergrinding Port land cement clinker and one or more forms of 
CaSO 4 with silica as specified in B.2 .2.1, or by subsequent blending  of separately produced Portland cement with 
separately ground silica flour as specified in B.2.2.1. At the manufacturer’s discreti on, another constituent

  C EMENTS AND MATERIALS FOR WELL CEMENTING  45 
(additive) as specified in B.2.2 may be interground or interble nded. When added, such other constituents shall be 
reported to the final user by content and type. 
This product is intended for use as a basic well cement and is available in O, MSR, and HSR grades, depending 
on the C 3A content of the Portland cement  clinker being interground or P ortland cement being blended to produce 
the product.   
B.2.1.3 Class L 
Class L composite well cement is obtained by intergrinding Port land cement clinker and one or more forms of 
CaSO 4 with fly ash as specified in B.2.2.3; with other pozzolanic ma terial as specified in B.2.2.2; by blending 
separately produced Portland cement with separately processed f ly ash as specified in B.2.2.3; or with other 
pozzolanic material as specified in B.2.2.2. At the manufacture r’s discretion, free-fluid at the manufacturer’s 
design water ratio may be adjust ed by using bentonite or other materials that provide suitable particle-suspending 
properties that, when added to the final pro duct, shall be repo rted to the final user by content and type. 
This product is intended for use under conditions when a lowe- density cement slu rry is desired. 
 Composite Constituents (Other than Portland Cement or Clinker) 
B.2.2.1 Silica 
Silica is synonymous wit h silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Silica exists in different for ms that can be crystalline (mo st 
commonly as quartz) as  well as non-cryst alline (amorphous). 
NOTE 1 A special form  of amorphous silica is silica fume specif ied, e.g. in EN 197-1.  
NOTE 2 Amorphous silica is no t considered in the context of thi s specification. 
The term silica in the context of this specification refers onl y to crystalline silica with a  silicon dioxide content of at 
least 90 %, the remainder being minerals that naturally occur i n conjunction with silico n dioxide. Silica flour or 
processed silica refers to cryst alline silica being produced to  a fineness that makes it su itable as a constituent for 
composite well cement Class K according to this annex. 
B.2.2.2 Pozzolanic Constituents 
B.2.2.2.1 General 
Pozzolanic materials are descri bed as siliceous (mainly in form  of reactive silicon dioxide, SiO 2) or siliceous and 
aluminous (mainly Al 2O3) materials, and iron oxide (Fe 2O3), with small amounts of oxi des of other elements that 
themselves possess little or no cementitious value but that wil l, in finely divided form and in the presence of 
moisture, chemically react with calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] at ordinary temperatures to form compounds 
possessing cementitious properties. These compounds are similar  to those that are formed in the hardening of 
Portland cement. 
Before use for manufacturing of API composite well cements acco rding to this annex, pozzolanic materials shall 
be correctly prepared, e.g. sele cted, homogenized, dried, or he at-treated and comminuted, depending on their 
state of production or delivery. 
Although some fly ashes have pozzo lanic properties, they are sp ecified separately (see B.2.2.3).

46  API  SPECIFICATION 10A 
B.2.2.2.2 Natural Pozzolanic Constituents 
Natural pozzolanic constituents are naturally occurring materia ls of volcanic origin, such as volcanic ashes, tuffs, 
pumices, etc., or sedimentary rocks with suitable chemical and mineralogical composition, and shall conform to 
the requirements given in B.2.2.2.1. 
B.2.2.2.3 Natural Calcined Pozzolanic Constituents 
Natural calcined pozzolanic constituents are materials of volca nic origin, clays, shales, or sedimentary rocks that 
are thermally treated to improve or activate their pozzolanic r eactivity, and shall conform to the requirements 
given in B.2.2.2.1.  
B.2.2.3 Fly Ashes 
Fly ash is the finely divided re sidue that results from the com bustion of ground or powdered coal. It is obtained by 
electrostatic or mechanical s eparation of fine particles from f urnace flue gases. 
Fly ash is called artificial p ozzolan and is the pozzolan most commonly used in well cement formulations. 
According to ASTM C618-08, a Class C fly ash is obtained by bur ning lignite or subbituminous coals. Class C fly 
ash has pozzolanic properties and also has some cementitious pr operties. Class C fly ash may have lime content 
higher than 10 %. 
According to ASTM C618-08, a Class F fly ash is produced as the  combustion residue from anthracite or 
bituminous coals. Class F fly a sh has pozzolanic properties. 
 Chemical Requirements 
Composite well cements shall conform to the respective chemical  requirements as stipulated in the following 
clauses. 
B.2.3.1 Class K 
The manufacturer of Class K is required to calculate and make a vailable to the end user the CaO-to-SiO 2 mole 
ratio of the finished product. This determines the capability o f the product to prevent or lessen strength 
retrogression at elevated well temperatures. Usually, such capa bility is given at a ratio lower than 1.25. For 
blended Class K composite well cements, this is usually accompl ished by adding high-purity silica in the 
magnitude of 35 % to 40 % by weight of cement. 
Chemical analysis of hydraulic cements shall be carried out as shown in ASTM C114 or EN 196-2, e.g. by X-ray 
fluorescence analysis. The CaO-to-SiO 2 mole ratio is calculated us ing the following formula:

𝑀SiO 2 is the molar mass of silic on dioxide (60.09 g/mol). 
NOTE In cement chemistry terms, CaO is abbreviated as C and SiO 2 is abbreviated as S. Therefore, CaO/SiO 2 often 
expressed as C/S mole ratio. 
EXAMPLE   CaO/SiO 2 mole ratio calculation in a sam ple of composite well cement of  100 g: 
mCaO = 47.43 g, here in 100 g of a  composite sample (= 47.43 %)

Class K composite well cement is further specified by sulfate-r esistance grades ordinary (O), moderate sulfate-
resistant (MSR), and high sulfat e-resistant (HSR). The sulfate- resistance grade of the finished Class K composite 
well cement depends on the percentage mass fraction of C 3A of the Portland cement clinker or the Portland 
cement—the first in case the co mposite well cement is manufactu red by intergrinding the composite constituents, 
and the latter in case the compos ite well cement is manufacture d by blending Portland cem ent with the composite 
constituents. The assignment of su lfate-resistance grades of Cl ass K to the C 3A content of Class K clinker or 
cement—whatever production method is chosen—is the same as for Classes A to H. For calculation of 
percentage mass fraction of C 3A of clinker and cement, the formul as as specified in Section 4 , Table 1 apply. 
NOTE Generally, the formulas of Section 4, Table 1 apply only t o the finished cement as an interground blend of Portland 
cement clinker and gypsum. When ap plying them to clinker only, the error due to the absence of gypsum can be considered 
as marginal (negligible) fo r the purpose of this annex. 
B.2.3.2 Class L 
The manufacturer of Class L shall calculate and make available to the end user the CaO-to-SiO 2 mole ratio of the 
finished product. 
No further chemical requirement s are set for Class L composite well cement. 
 Physical and Performance Requirements 
Composite well cements shall conform to the respective physical  and performance requirements given in Table 
B.1 and in accordance with Secti on 8 through 10. When reporting  results of specification  testing, the manufacturer 
shall always state them in conjunction with the applied mix wat er percentage at which these tests were 
performed. 
The manufacturer of Class L shall also state the slurry density4 at the design mix water percentage and at which 
mix water percentage the perfor mance tests were performed. 
Users of composite well cement m ay mix at different mix water p ercentages and with other modifying additives to 
meet the performance requirement s of the well in which it is to  be applied.

Annex C  
(normative)  
 
Calibration and Verification o f Well Cement Testing Equipment 
C.1 Overview 
This annex defines the requirements for calibration and verific ation of measurements by instruments used in 
testing cement for oil and gas well applications according to t he procedures prescribed in this document. 
Henceforth, the term “calibration” is used to mean either verif ication and/ or calibration according to the 
requirements of this document. Procedures will depend on the sp ecific instrument used for the calibration. 
Manufacturer’s instructions should be followed for the calibrat ion. Calibrations shall be conducted using 
instruments and devices traceable to national standards. 
NOTE Calibration refers to the verification of an instrument or  to the adjustments made to the instrument if it is out of 
calibration. If a verification shows the instrument to be in ca libration, the date and verification data will be the calibrati on. In this 
calibration section, the word “verification” pertains to instru ments that cannot be changed if  they are inaccurate, and the wo rd 
“calibrate” pertains to instruments that, if they are out of ca libration as seen by the “verific ation” of the instrument, may be 
adjusted to get them i nto calibration. 
C.2 General 
The following sections set the requirements for interval and ac curacy of calibration of devices used in a laboratory 
conducting tests according to this API specification. The requi rements by equipment type are given in Table C.1 
and the frequency and allowable tolerances are given in Table C .2. 
Volumetric glassware (graduated cylinders, conical flasks, and similar equipment) calibration is generally 
performed by the glassware supplier, and may be part of the pur chase specification. Glassware users should 
obtain documented evidence, where  deemed important, of glasswar e calibration from the supplier. Calibration 
may be checked gravimetrically before the first use. Periodic r ecalibration is not required. As specified in C.3.14, a 
procedure for graduated cylinders applicable to any volumetric glassware is detailed. 
Dimensions of apparatuses such as cube molds and consistometer parts for wear may be verified using a caliper 
accurate to at least 0.1 mm (0.005 in.).

cases, each cell or testing system shall be verified and/or cal ibrated (if not in calibration) individually, with a separate 
certificate showing a unique i dentifier for each testing system . Components that are common to all of the cells or 
testing systems need be calibra ted only once, but the calibrati on data shall be indicated on each certificate. 
When the device is being used for a test, and a verification or  calibration becomes due, the verification or calibration 
remains valid for the duration o f that test and the instrument should be calibrated a t the end of that test. 
C.3 Requirements 
 Balances 
Balances shall be verified and/or calibrated (if not in calibra tion) no less frequently than annually. Balances shall be 
accurate to 0.1 % of reading for measurement s made at 10 g or greater, up t o the full scale of the balance.  
Balances shall be accurate to  0.01 g of reading for measurement made less than 10 g.  Balanc es shall have two-
decimal-place precision at a minimum. Each range of a dual rang e balance shall be calibrated in this fashion. 
 Weight Sets 
Weight sets should be verified agai nst reference weights tracea ble to a national standard.  Weight sets to be verified 
include, but are not limited to , those used daily (routine weig hing), and those used to calibrate consistometer 
potentiometers (dedicated potentio meter calibration weight set)  or their equivalent.  
Weight sets should be verified and/or calibrated no less freque ntly than once annually. Weights should conform 
within 0.1 % of the nominal weight exc ept for weights with a mass equa l or less than 10 g (see Table C.3). Weights 
of 10 g and less should conform within 0.01 g of the nominal mass. If weights do not conform to the sp ecification, 
they should be discarded or sen t to the manufacturer for recert ification.

(12,000 r/min  500 r/min). The indicated speed shall not deviate by more than  these limits at either the low speed or 
the high speed from the true speed observed using a calibrated tachometer. If the mixing device is unable to control 
within the required range, the bl ender motor or controller shal l be repaired or replaced, as appropriate. 
NOTE The ability of the control ler to maintain speeds within th e required range during mixing a cement slurry is not a 
calibration issue. Typical motors available for the 1 L (1 quar t) mixer are 3.6 A/0.04HP and t he 7 A/0.7 HP; typically, the 3. 6 A 
motor will not maintain the tole rance, especially with viscous slurry.   
C.3.3.2 Blender Blade 
Initial blade weight and dimensions may vary due to the manufac turing process. The weight loss of the blender blade 
(blade only, not the blade assembly) shall be verified to be no  more than 10 % when it is changed. The mixing blade 
shall be weighed initially and prior to each production run tes ted or every 30 days, whichever is greater. Replace with 
an unused blade if obser ved blade deformation has occurred or a fter a blade has los t 10 % of its mass. 
Users will develop pr ocedures to ensure that the blade is not u sed with >10 % weight loss compared to its unused 
(out of the package) weight, and will develop a system to confi rm weight loss of the blade when it is changed. This 
system will include a method of  identifying the blender contain er in which the blade is installed. A log of blade 
weights and dates changed will be  maintained with the calibrati on records. A practical method of judging when a 
blade is approaching the limit in w eight loss is by comparing t he blade in the blender to a blade with known weight 
loss (see Figure C.1). The appearance of wear for a hardened bl ade may be different than shown in Figure C.1 for a 
non-hardened blade.

 C.3.3.3 Blender Timing Controller  
The blender timing controller device shall be verified against a calibrated timer (stopwatch) (see C.3.4), for 
12,000 r/min high s peed mixing time at 35 s ±1 s.   
 
Figure C.1—Worn Blade (right) Compared to a New One (left) 
 Timers 
Timers on all instruments shall be verified/and or calibrated ( if not in calibration) no less frequently than annually. 
This includes timers on consistometers, handheld timers, and an y other timer, whether as part of an instrument or 
separate. Timers shall be accurate to within ±5 seconds per hou r and shall be verified over a period of no less than 
12 minutes. Calibration may use the time signal from the NIST o r similar websites and radi o stations. If not within 
required accuracy, the units sha ll be adjusted or replaced. 
NOTE Blender timing devices (see C3.3.3) are not covered by thi s section.  
 Recorders 
Charts used for recording thickening times or other data shall be checked at least annually to ensure they vary by no 
more than 2 min/h. This can be done by running the chart, causi ng a deflection of the temperature or pressure trace 
at the beginning and end of one hour according to a calibrated timer, and measuring the deviation on the chart. The 
chart on which this recording is made shall be maintained with the calibration record for the instrument (as 
applicable: temperature, press ure, and/or con sistency).  
 Temperature Devices 
C.3.6.1 Temperature-measuring and -cont rolling devices shall be verifie d and/or calibrated (if not in calibration) no 
less frequently than quarterly. This includes thermometers, the rmocouples, and temperature controllers on 
consistometers, curing chambers,  and those that are used separa te from or are not an integr al part of the instrument. 
Measurements shall be made at no less than three temperatures s panning the manufacturer- or user-defined 
operating range of the equipment on or with which the device is  used. The lowest temperature calibrated shall be no 
more than 5 °C (10 °F) above the minimum and the highest temper ature calibrated shall be no more than 5 °C 
(10 °F) below the maximum of the user-defined operating range o f the instrument.

C.3.6.2 Thermometers or thermocouples shall be verified for accuracy by  use of a known temperature source (such 
as a heat block) with a thermometer or thermocouple that is cer tified and traceable to a national standardization 
body. Accuracy shall be within ±1 °C (±2 °F) or for special J t ype thermocouple accuracy shall be ±1.1 °C (±2 °F). If 
the thermometer or thermocouple error is greater than that, it shall be replaced by one meeting the accuracy 
requirements. Thermocouples mounted in the cylinder wall of a c onsistometer are exempt from calibration, but during 
the test, adjustments should be made to the controlling tempera ture when control is from the oil thermocouple, so the 
final temperature of the slurry i s within the required test tem perature. 
C.3.6.3 Temperature Control System 
Temperature-controlling systems consist of: 
 the sensing device (normally a thermocouple); 
— display (may be integral to c ontroller or may be separate); 
— the controller that receives input from the sensing device an d, in turn, provides output to the heating or cooling 
medium. The output circuit is not calibrated in this procedure;  and 
— all wiring, connectors, etc. between the sensor and the contr oller. 
The temperature controller may be verified and/or calibrated wh ile connected to its thermocouple placed in a 
calibrated heat source or using a cold-junction compensated inp ut device in place of the thermocouple. If the 
controller is calibrated using a cold-junction compensated inpu t device, the thermocouple shall be calibrated 
independently. The thermometer or thermocouple that is used for  the verification of calibration tolerance shall be 
certified and traceable to a national standardization body. The  controller accuracy shall be wi thin ±1 °C (±2 °F). If the 
system is not within the require d accuracy, the source of the i naccuracy should be determined and the component(s) 
that is (are) not within the r equired accuracy shall be adjuste d or replaced. 
The temperature controller shall be verified for accuracy at an  interval no less than quarterly and be checked at no 
less than three temperatures spanning the operating range of th e equipment on or with which the device is used.  
The lowest temperature calibrated shall be no more than 5 °C (1 0 °F) above the minimum and the highest 
temperature calibrated shall be no more than 5 °C (10 °F) below  the maximum of the user-defined operating range of 
the instrument. 
Temperature displays that are separate from the controller shal l be calibrated by the same methods used to calibrate 
the controller. Separate displays  shall have their own calibrat ion record. 
C.3.6.4 Temperature Data Acquisition 
See C.3.13 for temperat ure data acquisition. 
C.3.6.5 Guidance for Tempe rature Device C alibration 
This subsection provides additional guidance for temperature de vice calibration. 
C.3.6.5.1 Heating Medium 
The heating medium shall permit proper immersion of both the te st thermocouple (the one being verified/calibrated) 
and the reference thermocouple or thermometer. The medium may b e a fluidized solids bath, a heated block, or a 
furnace. The equipment shall be capable of maintaining a stable  temperature that is uniform throughout the test 
section. If the heat source (heat er and instrument) is portable , it should be allowed to stabilize at the ambient 
temperature prior to being used. This is especially true when t he instrument is removed from a car or storage room, 
etc. 
C.3.6.5.2 Procedure 
Items listed here are those needing special attention or relate d to the use of the indicated type of equipment.

  The test and reference thermocouple or thermometer shall be pl aced as close together in the heating medium as 
possible. 
— After each change of the temper ature setting, the temperature  of the heating medium sha ll be allowed to stabilize 
before reading the reference temperature (or voltage) and the t est thermocouple temperature (or voltage). If 
several thermocouples are checked in sequence, each one shall b e allowed to reach a stable reading before 
making the calibration measurement. 
— If the test thermocouple does not accurately sense the temper ature, a calibration curve shall be drawn and used 
to correct the indicated temper atures from the test thermocoupl e. Occasionally, small inaccuracies in 
thermocouple response can be compensated for during the calibra tion of the temperatur e-measuring system 
being used in conjunction with t he thermocouple (see C.3.6.3). 
C.3.6.5.3 Verification and Calib ration of Temperature-measuring  Systems and Controllers 
C.3.6.5.3.1 Equipment 
The verification/calibration of temperature-measuring systems a nd controllers requires a millivolt source, the correct 
connecting thermocouple extension cable for the type of thermoc ouple being used, and possibly a thermometer and 
a table of reference voltages. Signal sources, or calibrators, are of two types, namely uncompensated and cold-
junction compensated. Several com mercial calibrators are availa ble that are cold-junction compensated and have a 
digital display of the temperat ure equivalent of the millivolt signal being supplied. The accuracy of all calibration 
equipment shall be traceable to national standards certificatio n. Some older galvanometer-type temperature-
indicating instruments and controllers require a stronger signa l for operation than the newer potentiometric and 
digital-type temperature-measuri ng systems and controllers, and  thus require a calibrator with sufficient signal 
strength to give an accurate calibration. 
An alternate method consists of placing the thermocouple that i s connected to the controlling or indicating instrument 
into a heat source and comparing it with a calibrated thermocou ple or thermometer. The temperature of the heat 
source is then changed as specified in C.3.6.5.2 to certify tha t the controlling or indicatin g instrument is accurately 
calibrated. 
C.3.6.5.3.2 Procedure 
— Follow the manufacturer’s procedure for calibrating temperatu re-measuring systems and controllers. For greatest 
accuracy, allow proper warm-up time for calibrators, temperatur e-measuring systems, and controllers as 
specified by the manufacturer. T he following items need special  attention: 
— Fit the thermocouple extension cable with a proper thermocoup le-grade adapter to permit plugging it into 
the same receptacle used for connecting the test equipment ther mocouple. Take care to ensure the correct 
polarity of the connections. 
— Thermocouple calibrators with cold-junction compensation need  only be properly connected with the proper 
thermocouple extension cable and thermocouple connectors. The t emperature-measuring systems and/or 
controllers using this signal shall display the same temperatur e within the accuracy of the thermometer or 
controllers as supplied by the manufacturer. 
— Uncompensated thermocouple calibrators require a thermometer to determine the cold-junction temperature 
of the thermocouple extension c able connection of the calibrato r. This cold-junction te mperature shall be set 
on the calibrator by the operator. 
— The use of an uncompensated m illivolt potentiometer requires that the temperature at the 
calibrator/thermocouple extension cable terminals be read with a thermometer of known accuracy. The 
millivolt equivalent of this temperature is then subtracted fro m the equivalent test millivolt signal to obtain 
the calibrator millivolt signal u sed. These volt ages may be fou nd in reference millivolt/temperature tables for 
the type of thermocouple in use. 
— The temperature of the calibration instrument should be allow ed to stabilize at the ambient temperature at 
the location where it is being used. This is especially true wh en the instrument is removed from a car or a 
storage room, etc.

C.3.6.5.4 Specific Procedure fo r Atmospheric Pressure Consistom eter 
When verifying the temperature calibration of an atmospheric pr essure consistometer, place one slurry container in 
the unit and leave the second one out. Place the reference ther mocouple (attached to a master temperature 
calibration instrument) in the open hole as close as possible t o the atmospheric pressure consistometer 
thermocouple, and heat the consistometer to no less than three temperatures from ambient temperature to 88 °C 
(190 °F) to verify the accuracy of the temperature indication. Calibrate the controller if it is not in calibration. If it is in 
calibration, use the verification as the calibration and date i t for reference. 
C.3.6.5.5 Specific Procedure fo r Atmospheric Pressure Water Bat h 
When verifying the temperature calibration of an atmospheric pr essure water bath, place a stirring device in the bath 
(if it does not have one) along wi th a reference thermocouple a ttached to a master temperature calibration instrument 
in the water bath. Heat the wate r bath to no less than three di fferent temperatures from ambi ent temperature to 88 °C 
(190 °F) to verify the accuracy of the temperature indication. Calibrate the controller if it is not in calibration. If it is in 
calibration, use the verification as the calibration and date i t for reference 
 Instrument Rotation 
Rotation of consistometer containers (or paddles) at 150 r/min shall be verified and/or calibrated (if not in calibration) 
no less frequently than quarterly. The tolerance measured by a calibrated tachometer shall not deviate more than 
±15 r/min.  
 Pressurized Consistometer Slurry Container Assembly   
Pressurized slurry container, paddle, and paddle shaft key dime nsions (dimensions tagged as “INSP”; see 
Figures 10 to 13) shall be verified to judge wear; the maximum acceptable wear is 1 mm (0.04 in.). Dimensions shall 
be verified no less frequently than annually or whenever a padd le or a paddle shaft is replaced. If dimensions are 
found outside tolerances, the slurry container part needs to be  discarded. For these pressuri zed consistometer parts, 
laboratories should devise a  method of identifying them. 
To verify dimensions, a caliper  accurate to 0.05 mm (0.002 in.)  at minimum is required. 
 Consistency Measurement Device or Potentiometer 
C.3.9.1 General 
The potentiometer or other consistency-measuring device shall b e verified and/or calibrated (if not in calibration) no 
less frequently than monthly. A new calibration is required whe never repairs or adjustments are made to the device 
(such as calibration spring, resistor, or contact arm). Accurac y shall be maintained within 5 Bc (if output is in Bc) or 
0.5 V (if output is in volts) across the calibration range. Whe n the calibration is of a sy stem (potentiometer, wiring, 
voltmeter, etc.), for the calibration to be valid, the potentio meter shall be kept together with the consistometer with 
which it has been calibrated. For  these systems, laboratories s hould devise a method of identifying the potentiometer 
with the consistometer on which it is calibrated and ensure it is only used on that consistometer. 
Some potentiometer calibration devices allow the potentiometer to be calibrated so that the voltage output is fixed 
based on applied load (equivalent to Bc). In such a case, provided all potentiometers are adjusted to the same 
voltage output vs load  [or consistency ( Bc)], the potentiometers may be in terchanged between machines. 
C.3.9.2 Procedure 
A calibration chart or table showing indicated consistency vs i nput consistency (mass) shall be maintained. The 
entire range of consistencies s hall be checked as given in Tabl e C.4. Consistency values shall be reported based on 
the calibration curve or table. 
A weight-loaded device (see Figu re C.2 for a typical potentiome ter calibrating device and Figure 14 for a typical 
potentiometer) is used to produce  a series of torque-equivalent  values for consistency, defined by:

 where  
T  is torque, expressed in gram•centimeters (g•cm);  
Bc  is consistency, expressed in Bearden units. 
Dedicated potentiometer calibration weights are used to apply t orque to the potentiometer spring, using the radius of 
the potentiometer frame as a lev er arm. Weights cause a deflect ion, and the resulting DC voltage is recorded and 
used to determine Bc (alternatively, some instruments display the Bc equivalent directly). Slurry consistencies at 
±5 Bc versus equivalent torques (mass of dedicated calibration weigh ts at ±0.1 % of the indicated mass; see C.3.2) 
for a potentiometer with a radius of 52 mm ±1 mm are given in T able C.4. Operating instructions from the 
manufacturer should be followed for proper calibration.

C.3.14.1 General 
Calibration of pipettes, graduated cylinders, conical flasks, a nd similar equipment is generally performed by the

 Annex D 
(informative)  
 
Calibration Procedures for Thermocouples,  
Temperature-measuring Systems, and Controllers 
D.1 Calibration Methods 
There are several satisfactory methods for calibrating thermoco uples, including methods supplied by equipment 
manufacturers. See ASTM E220 for a more complete discussion of these procedures. No ASTM procedures for 
calibration of temperature-measuring systems are available. 
D.2 Thermocouple Calibration 
 Apparatus 
D.2.1.1 General 
The individual pieces of the apparatus required to carry out th e calibration depend on the particular technique 
selected. Those features that need special attention, regardles s of the technique, have the requirements given in 
D.2.1.2 through D.2.1.4. 
D.2.1.2 Heating Environment 
The heating medium should permit proper immersion of both the t est thermocouple (the one being calibrated) and 
the reference thermocouple or reference thermometer. The appara tus should be capable of maintaining a stable 
temperature that is uniform  throughout the te st section. 
D.2.1.3 Temperature Measurement 
The reference temperature of the heating medium may be measured  by using either a thermometer or a 
thermocouple. The accuracy of the reference measuring device sh ould be traceable to the reference of a 
national/international standardization body. 
D.2.1.4 Thermocouple Voltage Output 
If a thermocouple is used to sense the reference temperature, t he voltage output from the reference thermocouple 
and test thermocouple should be determined as described in appl icable national standards; see ASTM E220. In this 
case, tables of temperature vs voltage for the type of thermoco uple being used should be consulted to determine the 
temperature. Alternatively, a direct-reading, temperature-compe nsated readout instrument may be used. The 
accuracy of the instrument should be traceable to national stan dards certification. 
 Procedure 
With the exception of the indica ting instruments, the specific procedures are detailed in applicable national 
standards; see ASTM E220. The following items require special a ttention or are related to  the use of the indicating 
type of equipment. 
a) The test and reference thermocouples or thermometers should be placed as close together as possible in the 
heating medium. 
b) After each change in heating level, the temperature should b e allowed to remain at a stable value for 15 min 
before reading the reference te mperature (or voltage) and the t est thermocouple temperature (or voltage). 
c) Several (minimum three) test temperatures that span the oper ating range of the equipment should be used in 
the calibration procedure.

  C EMENTS AND MATERIALS FOR WELL CEMENTING  65 
 
d) If the test thermocouple error is greater than that specifie d by the manufacturer, the thermocouple should be 
replaced by one that meets the thermocouple accuracy limits. Th e requirements given in ASTM E230 for 
classification of “special” Type J thermocouple has error limit s equal to or better than ±1.1 °C (±2 °F) up to 
275 °C (530 °F) and 0.4 % of the reading above 400 °F. 
D.3 Calibration of Temperature- measuring Systems and Controller s 
 Apparatus 
The calibration of temperature-measuring systems and controller s requires a millivolt source, the correct connecting 
thermocouple extension cable fo r the type of thermocouple being  used, and, possibly, a ther mometer with a table of 
reference voltages. Signal sources, or calibrators, are of two types: uncompensated and co ld-junction compensated. 
Several commercial calibrators are available that are cold-junc tion compensated and have a digital display of the 
temperature equivalent to the m illivolt signal being supplied. The accuracy of all calibration apparatuses should be 
traceable to a national standard certification. Some older galv anometer-type temperature-indicating instruments and 
controllers require a stronger signal for operation than the ne wer potentiometric and digital-type temperature 
measuring systems and controlle rs and, therefore, require a cal ibrator with sufficient signal strength to give an 
accurate calibration. 
 Procedure 
The manufacturer's procedure for calibrating temperature-measur ing systems and controllers should be followed. 
The following items require special attention. 
a) The thermocouple extension cable should be fitted with a pro per thermocouple grade adapter to permit plugging 
it into the same receptacle us ed for connecting the test equipm ent thermocouple. Care should be taken to 
ensure the correct polarity of the connections. Calibrators, te mperature-measuring systems, and controllers 
should be allowed proper warm- up time, as specified by the manu facturer, for greatest accuracy. 
b) It is only necessary that thermocouple calibrators with cold -junction compensation be properly connected with 
the proper thermocouple extension cable and thermocouple connec tors. The temperature-measuring systems 
and/or controllers using this signal should have the same tempe rature readout, within the accuracy of the 
temperature or controllers as supplied by the manufacturer. 
c) Uncompensated thermocouple calibrators require a thermometer  to determine the cold-junction temperature of 
the thermocouple extension cable connection of the calibrator. This cold-junction temperature is set on the 
calibrator by the operator. 
The use of an uncompensated m illivolt potentiometer requires th at the temperature at the calibrator/thermocouple 
extension cable terminals be read with a thermometer of known a ccuracy. The millivolt equivalent of this temperature 
is then subtracted from  the equivalent test millivolt signal to  obtain the calibrator millivolt signal used. These voltages 
may be found in refer ence mV/temperature tables for the type of  thermocouple in use.
