Standard Speciﬁcation for
Portland Cement1
This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation C150/C150M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.A superscript epsilon ( ´) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.
1. Scope*
1.1 This speciﬁcation covers ten types of portland cement,
as follows (see Note 2 ):
1.1.1 Type I— For general use, when the special properties
speciﬁed for any other type are not required.
1.1.2 Type IA— Air-entraining cement for the same uses as
Type I, where air-entrainment is desired.
1.1.3 Type II— For general use, more especially when mod-
erate sulfate resistance is desired.
1.1.4 Type IIA— Air-entraining cement for the same uses as
Type II, where air-entrainment is desired.
1.1.5 Type II(MH)— For general use, more especially when
moderate heat of hydration and moderate sulfate resistance aredesired.
1.1.6 Type II(MH)A— Air-entraining cement for the same
uses as Type II(MH), where air-entrainment is desired.
1.1.7 Type III— For use when high early strength is desired.
1.1.8 Type IIIA— Air-entraining cement for the same use as
Type III, where air-entrainment is desired.
1.1.9 Type IV— For use when a low heat of hydration is
desired.
1.1.10 Type V— For use when high sulfate resistance is
desired.
NOTE 1—Some cements are designated with a combined type
classiﬁcation, such as Type I/II, indicating that the cement meets therequirements of the indicated types and is being offered as suitable for usewhen either type is desired.
N
OTE2—Cement conforming to the requirements for all types are not
carried in stock in some areas. In advance of specifying the use of cementother than Type I, determine whether the proposed type of cement is or canbe made available.
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated ineach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, eachsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combiningvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformancewith the standard. Values in SI units [or inch-pound units] shallbe obtained by measurement in SI units [or inch-pound units]or by appropriate conversion, using the Rules for Conversion
and Rounding given in
IEEE/ASTM SI 10 , of measurements
made in other units [or SI units]. Values are stated in only SIunits when inch-pound units are not used in practice.
1.3 The text of this speciﬁcation references notes and
footnotes which provide explanatory material. These notes andfootnotes (excluding those in tables and ﬁgures) shall not beconsidered as requirements of the standard.
1.4This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-ization established in the Decision on Principles for theDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom-mendations issued by the World Trade Organization TechnicalBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

formulating concrete mixtures, including calculating alkali loading usingequivalent alkali content of cement to minimize the potential for ASR, isprovided in Guide
C1778 .
NOTE6—The limit on the sum, C3S + 4.75(C3A), in Table 1 provides
control on the heat of hydration of the cement and is consistent with a TestMethod
C1702 three-day heat of hydration limit of 315 kJ/kg [75 cal ⁄g].
NOTE7—There are cases where performance of a cement is improved
with SO3in excess of the Table 1 limits in this speciﬁcation. Guide C563
is one of several methods a manufacturer can use to evaluate the effect ofsulfate content on cement characteristics. Whenever SO
3content of a
cement exceeds Table 1 limits, Test Method C1038/C1038M results
provide evidence that excessive expansion does not occur at this highersulfate content.

12.2 When limestone is used, the manufacturer shall state in
writing the amount thereof and, if requested by the purchaser,shall supply comparative test data on chemical and physicalproperties of the cement with and without the limestone (see
Note 8 ). The comparative tests do not supersede the normal
testing to conﬁrm that the cement meets chemical and physicalrequirements of this speciﬁcation. The amount of limestone incement shall be determined in accordance with
Annex A2 .
NOTE8—Comparative test data may be from qualiﬁcation tests per-
formed by the manufacturer during formulation of the cement withlimestone.
12.3 At the request of the purchaser, the manufacturer shall
report the chloride content as determined using Test Methods
C114 , in percent by mass of the cement, in the manufacturer’s
report (see Note 9 ).
NOTE9—Chlorides in concrete come from multiple ingredients and
cement chloride content may be required to estimate concrete chloridecontent. Requirements for concrete chloride content are provided inbuilding codes and other documents.
13. Packaging and Package Marking
13.1 When the cement is delivered in packages, the words
“Portland Cement,” the type of cement, the name and brand ofthe manufacturer, and the mass of the cement contained thereinshall be plainly marked on each package. When the cement isan air-entraining type, the words “air-entraining” shall beplainly marked on each package. Similar information shall beprovided in the shipping documents accompanying the ship-
ment of packaged or bulk cement. All packages shall be ingood condition at the time of inspection.
NOTE10—With the change to SI units, it is desirable to establish a
standard SI package for portland cements. To that end 42 kg [92.6 lb]provides a convenient, even-numbered mass reasonably similar to thetraditional 94-lb [42.6 kg] package.
14. Storage
14.1 The cement shall be stored in such a manner as to
permit easy access for proper inspection and identiﬁcation ofeach shipment, and in a suitable weather-tight building thatwill protect the cement from dampness and minimize ware-house set.
15. Manufacturer’s Certiﬁcation
15.1 Upon request of the purchaser in the contract or order,
a manufacturer’s report shall be furnished at the time ofshipment stating the results of tests made on samples of thematerial taken during production or transfer and certifying thatthe cement conforms to applicable requirements of this speci-ﬁcation.

ANNEXES
(Mandatory Information)
A1. CALCULATION OF POTENTIAL CEMENT PHASE COMPOSITION
A1.1 All values calculated as described in this annex shall
be rounded in accordance with Practice E29. When evaluating
conformance to a speciﬁcation, round values to the samenumber of places as the corresponding table entry beforemaking comparisons. The expressing of chemical limitationsby means of calculated assumed phases does not necessarilymean that the oxides are actually or entirely present as suchphases.
A1.2 When expressing phases, C = CaO, S = SiO
2,
A=A l2O3, F=F e2O3. For example, C3A = 3CaO·Al2O3.T i -
tanium dioxide and phosphorus pentoxide (TiO2and P2O5)
shall not be included with the Al2O3content (see Note A1.1 ).
NOTEA1.1—When comparing oxide analyses and calculated phases
from different sources or from different historic times, be aware that theymay not have been reported on exactly the same basis. Chemical dataobtained by Reference and Alternate Test Methods of Test Methods
C114
(wet chemistry) may include titania and phosphorus as alumina unlessproper correction has been made (see Test Methods
C114 ), while data
obtained by rapid instrumental methods usually do not. This can result insmall differences in the calculated phases. Such differences are usuallywithin the precision of the analytical methods, even when the methods areproperly qualiﬁed under the requirements of Test Methods
C114 .
A1.3 When the ratio of percentages of aluminum oxide to
ferric oxide is 0.64 or more, the percentages of tricalciumsilicate, dicalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, and tetracal-cium aluminoferrite shall be calculated from the chemical
analysis as follows:
Tricalcium silicate (C3S) = (4.071 × % CaO) – (7.60 0×%S i O2)
– (6.718 × % Al2O3)–( 1 . 4 3 0×%F e2O3)–( 2 . 8 5 2×%S O3)
(A1.1)
Dicalcium silicate (C2S )=( 2 . 8 6 7×%S i O2)–( 0 . 7 5 4 4×%C3S)
(A1.2)
Tricalcium aluminate (C3A) = (2.650 × % Al2O3)–( 1 . 6 9 2×%F e2O3)
(A1.3)
Tetracalcium aluminoferrite (C4A F )=3 . 0 4 3×%F e2O3
(A1.4)
A1.3.1 When the alumina-ferric oxide ratio is less than 0.64,
a calcium aluminoferrite solid solution (expressed asss(C
4A F+C2F)) is formed. No tricalcium aluminate will be
